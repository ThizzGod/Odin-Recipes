    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Scotch eggs are a traditional british pub food (not originally from scotland)
        which consist of a boiled egg, covered with breakfast sausage, breaded, and fried.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>5 large eggs, divided.</li>
        <li>1 small bunch of fresh chives.</li>
        <li>3 large sprigs fresh parsley.</li>
        <li>10 ounces uncooked breakfast sausage, casings removed.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon prepared English mustard, such as Colemans.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed.</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>1/2 packed teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg.</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>6 cups (48 ounces) vegetable oil, for deep-frying.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 4 of the large eggs in a medium saucepan and add enough cold water to cover by an inch. 
            Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil for 4 minutes for a jammy egg yolk or 7 minutes 
            for a well-done yolk. Meanwhile, fill a medium bowl with ice water.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are ready, drain and transfer to the ice water bath. Let sit until cooled, 5 to 10 minutes. 
            Meanwhile, prepare the parchment, sausage mixture, and dredging mixtures.</li>
        <li>Cut a 6-inch square of parchment paper. Very finely chop 1 small bunch fresh chives until you have 1 tablespoon. 
            Pick and finely chop the leaves from 3 large fresh parsley sprigs until you have 1 tablespoon.</li>
        <li>Place the chives, parsley, 10 ounces breakfast sausage (casings removed), 1 tablespoon prepared English mustard, 
            1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/2 packed teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg in a medium bowl. 
            Fold and mix until combined. Divide the sausage mixture into 4 portions and form each into a ball.</li>
        <li>Place 1/3 cup all-purpose flour and a pinch of kosher salt in a small bowl and whisk to combine. 
            Place 1 cup panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of kosher salt in a small bowl and whisk to combine. 
            Crack the remaining 1 large egg in a small bowl and whisk until broken up.</li>
        <li>Gently peel the eggs and pat dry with a paper towel. Wrap 1 egg at a time: 
            Place 1 sausage ball on the parchment and press with your hands into a flat oval (about 6 inches long) 
            that will completely wrap around an egg. Gently coat 1 egg in the flour. Place the egg in the middle of the sausage oval 
            and use the parchment to wrap the sausage around the egg until it is completely covered. 
            Peel back the parchment to release and use it to gently mold and seal the egg in the sausage. Place on a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat 6 cups vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until 325ºF. 
            Meanwhile, bread the wrapped eggs one at a time: Coat in the flour again and shake off the excess. 
            Dip in the beaten egg until completely coated and let the excess drip off. Dip in the breadcrumb mixture until completely coated, 
            gently pressing the breadcrumbs to adhere, mold, and shape as needed. Return to the plate.</li>
        <li>Using a spider or slotted spoon, gently lower all the Scotch eggs into the hot oil and fry until the sausage is cooked through 
            (the tip of an instant-read thermometer should register at least 145ºF when inserted into the sausage layer) and the outside is deep golden-brown, 4 to 6 minutes. 
            Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
